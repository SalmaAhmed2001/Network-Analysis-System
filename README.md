Analyzing the Gene Interaction Network of Escherichia Coli K12, Bos Taurus (cattle), and Oryza Sativam Rattus Norvegicus (rat)  using Python, Network Graphs (NetworkX) Degree Distribution and Node Connectivity and Probability Distributions

The code reads a file containing information on the interactions between genes in Files and creates a directed graph object using NetworkX. It then calculates the degree of each node in the graph and generates several plots of the degree distribution, including a bar plot and a log-log plot.

Finally, the code prints out the degree values for each node in the graph, which can provide additional insights into the connectivity and organization of the gene network in E. coli K12, Oryza Sativa(rice), and Bos Taurus (cattle), Rattus Norvegicus (rat)as identified the top 20 nodes with the highest degree values (i.e., hubs). This can provide insights into the most influential genes in the gene network of Bos Taurus and help identify potential targets for further study.
